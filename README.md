# Maze-Generator-using-BFS-algorithm
Maze Generator using BFS algorithm in python using Turtle and Tkinter library
Tkinter is used to create the buttons which is used to select the size of grids for generating maze.
Turtle is used to define the turtle which is used to create the walls and generating(stamping) the path in the project.
Breadth-first-search(BFS) algorithm is used to generate the maze.
